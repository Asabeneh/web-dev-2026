# Web Development Training – Week 1: Course Introduction & Foundations

## Course Overview
This is a **10-week web development course** (with 9 weeks remaining after the first session) designed for beginners and those building foundational skills.  
The training covers the full web development stack:

- **Front-end development**: What users see and interact with (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- **Back-end development**: Server-side logic, data processing, storage, and authentication (e.g., Node.js, Python, databases)
- **Full-stack development**: Combining both front-end and back-end skills

The course emphasizes hands-on practice, modern tools, collaboration via version control, and the productive use of **AI** to support (but not replace) your own thinking and problem-solving.

Key goals:
- Understand how the web works
- Build and deploy simple websites
- Develop good development habits (practice after each lesson, use version control, ask questions)
- Prepare for real-world collaboration and professional growth

## How the Web Works – Restaurant Analogy
Imagine ordering food at a restaurant:

- **You (the client/browser)**: Look at the menu (request a page), place an order (send HTTP request)
- **Kitchen & staff (the server)**: Prepare the food (process request, fetch/store data), send it back
- **HTTP protocol**: The "language" used for communication between client and server

Most websites involve this client-server model. Understanding this big picture helps before learning specific technologies.

## Core Web Development Roles
- **Front-end developer**: Focuses on user interface and experience → HTML (structure), CSS (styling & layout), JavaScript (interactivity)
- **Back-end developer**: Handles data, logic, security, databases → Node.js, Python, etc.
- **Full-stack developer**: Works on both front-end and back-end

Example platform demonstration: A learning platform shows how front-end displays courses and login forms, while back-end manages user accounts, stores progress permanently in a database, and handles authentication.

## Essential Tools & Setup (Install & Configure Before Next Session)
1. **Visual Studio Code** (VS Code) – Free, powerful code editor  
   - Enable **auto-save** in settings (avoids manual saving)
   - Install extensions later (e.g., Live Server for auto-refreshing pages)

2. **Git Bash** (or Git for Windows/Mac) – For command line work

3. **Google Chrome** (or another modern browser) – For viewing and debugging websites

4. **GitHub account** – Required for collaboration, version control, and free website hosting

5. **Telegram group** – For questions, sharing ideas, course materials, and announcements

Additional recommendations:
- Keep your **webcam on** during live sessions (improves engagement and interaction)
- Allocate time after each lesson to **practice** what was covered

## Key Concepts Covered on Day 1

### 1. Command Line Basics
Use the terminal (Git Bash) to:
- Create folders and files
- Navigate directories
- Create basic HTML files

Practice common commands (covered in the recommended Git/GitHub materials).

### 2. HTML Basics
HTML structures web page content.

Basic document structure:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My First Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- This is a comment -->
    <h1>Main Heading (H1)</h1>
    <h2>Subheading (H2)</h2>
    <p>This is a paragraph. Use Lorem Ipsum for placeholder text when needed.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

- Headings: `<h1>` to `<h6>` (semantic importance decreases from h1 → h6)
- Paragraphs: `<p>`
- Comments: `<!-- comment here -->`
- Meta tags: Important for SEO and mobile responsiveness

### 3. CSS Basics (Introduction)
- Controls appearance (colors, spacing, layout)
- Uses the **box model**: Every element is a box with content, padding, border, and margin

More CSS and styling will be covered in upcoming weeks.

### 4. Semantic HTML5
Use meaningful tags (e.g., `<section>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`) instead of generic `<div>` for better accessibility, SEO, and maintainability.

### 5. Git, GitHub & Deployment
GitHub provides:
- Version control (track changes)
- Collaboration
- Free hosting for static websites

Basic workflow demonstrated:
1. Create a repository on GitHub
2. Write code locally (e.g., in VS Code)
3. Commit changes
4. Push to GitHub
5. Deploy (GitHub Pages turns repositories into live websites)

## Next Steps & Assignments (Complete Before Next Session)
1. Create a **GitHub account** (if you don't have one)
2. Go through the **10 Days of Git and GitHub** course materials (shared in the group; includes step-by-step lessons on installing Git, basic commands, repositories, commits, branches, etc.)
3. Learn **Markdown** syntax (used for README files, issues, and writing on GitHub)
4. Install **Visual Studio Code** and **Git Bash**
5. Practice basic command line commands from the Git/GitHub materials
6. Work through the Git and GitHub materials thoroughly
7. Allocate regular practice time after lessons
8. Report any setup/technical difficulties at the start of next session

A dedicated Git/GitHub mini-course with quizzes and assignments will be shared soon.

## Tips for Success
- Use **AI tools** (e.g., for generating code snippets, explanations, or presentation content) to accelerate learning — but always understand and write your own code
- Practice consistently: Small daily effort compounds quickly
- Share questions and progress in the group
- Review recordings/demos if needed (especially deployment parts)
- Focus on the **big picture** first, then dive deeper into each technology

Next week: More on categorizing content with semantic tags (e.g., `<section>`), deeper CSS, and continued Git/GitHub practice.

Welcome to the journey — consistent effort will turn you into a capable web developer! 🚀
